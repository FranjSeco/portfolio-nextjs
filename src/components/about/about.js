            I&apos;m certified web developer specialized in React and Node.js, capable of build the
            front and the back-end. I consider myself a very motivated and hard worker person, with
            an eye for the detail. I understand the importance of the design, therefore I try to
            always develop the projects I work on with a mobile first approach. Responsiveness is
            key in all the projects I participate.
            <br />

            If my work has caught your attention, please do not hesitate to contact me.

            <br />
            Iâ€™m interested in a full time remote position within a company that allows me to keep
            growing and improving myself.
